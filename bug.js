This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and providing an incorrect keyExtractor function. The keyExtractor is crucial for efficient rendering and updates; if it doesn't provide unique keys for each item, React Native might struggle to identify and update items correctly leading to unexpected behavior and visual glitches. For example, if you use the index as a key and the items in your data array change order, the items might not update correctly visually, or if you add/remove items, you might see flickering or incorrect item positioning.
