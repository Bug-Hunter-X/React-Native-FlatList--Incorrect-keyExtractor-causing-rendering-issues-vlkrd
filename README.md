This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native's FlatList component: using an incorrect `keyExtractor` function. The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, leading to incorrect rendering and item updates. The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected code, ensuring that unique keys are assigned to each item, resolving the rendering issues.  The error arises when using the index as a key or when keys are not unique across items. This can result in unexpected behavior, including incorrect item positioning, flickering, and failure to update correctly when data changes. Using a unique identifier for each item, such as a database ID or UUID, prevents these problems.
